# Unit Programming Language

Unit is a high level imperative lisp dialect that aims to 
target real time applications such as cli and gui programs.
It is written in Odin and aims to target the LLVM platform.

Unit is far from finished and is currently a prototype, which 
only the parser is partially implemented.

To test out the prototype parser: 

```bash
odin build . 
./unit file.unit
```
